# Auto Price Prediction Project
## This Project is a sample procedure to use Python machine learning regression model to predict car price from a sample data.

**Module 1:** [Exploratory Data Analysis](./exploratoryDataAnalysis.py)
- Used summary statistics to understand the basics of a data set.
- Used several types of plots to display distributions.
- Created scatter plots with different transparency.
- Used density plots and hex bin plots to overcome overplotting.
- Applied aesthetics to project additional dimensions of categorical and numeric variables onto a 2d plot surface.
- Used pair-wise scatter plots and conditioned plots to create displays with multiple axes.
